Windows Server lab with AD DS, DNS, DHCP, and File Services using a Marvel-themed domain structure
# Marvel-Themed Active Directory Lab (AD DS + DNS + DHCP)

## 1. Overview
This project is a Windows Server home lab built to simulate a small enterprise environment using Active Directory, DNS, DHCP, and File Services.

The lab uses a Marvel-themed structure (Avengers, X-Men, Fantastic Four) to represent organizational units, users, and security groups.
